**`Advanced Beginner Software Developer/Front-End Developer`**

I'm a passionate software engineering student with a strong desire to continuously enhance my skills. Every day, I embrace opportunities to learn and grow, both as a freelancer and through personal projects. Prior to my coding journey, I had initially planned to pursue art school, as visual illustration and design were major passions of mine. Now, I have found my niche in front-end development, where I can merge my creative background with coding to create impactful user experiences.
